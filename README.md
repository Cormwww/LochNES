# Resources
- https://github.com/bugzmanov/nes_ebook, where it all started for me
- https://www.nesdev.org, no NES emulator is built without it
- https://archive.org/details/6502UsersManual/mode/2up, a nice reference to the 6502 processor (not the Ricoh version though)
- https://austinmorlan.com/posts/nes_rendering_overview, a great resource to understand how PPU works
